# Binance-Analysis-and-Prediction

Python-Binance is an application programming interface that allows you to connect and interact with the Binance servers via the Python programming language. Analyzing, interacting, and automating the trading processes can be done using this application.

## Project Architecture Flow
The architecture outlines what we intend to explore in this article, giving a step-by-step walk through the entire process.

In this article, I will show you how to connect your Python to Binance API to get real-time data with the Python-Binance library, clean and transform the data using Pandas, analyze the data using mplfinance and create a predictive model using the Tensorflow Keras library.
